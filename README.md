I currently have 5 datasets I am planning on using, although some of the columns/data may not be used by the end.   
world happiness report WHR- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated which encapsulates 2005-2024  
world happiness index & inflation WHI- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agrafintech/world-happiness-index-and-inflation-dataset covering 2015-2023  
suicide rate and life expectancy L&D- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/suicide-rate-and-life-expectancy which I merged into 1 single dataset using "Country" as a key value  
Global Country Information Dataset 2023 world_data- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023 from 2023  

Scatter plot made, based some logic on info from WHO https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/financial-protection  
Made 2 bar plots based on fertility rates and suicide rates and how happiness affects those rates.
Made a line chart based on the bottom 20 countries, all with a happiness score under 5, showing their life expectancy of men and women. 
Decided I needed SQL tables to continue my plot work, so have converted 2 tables to SQL so far  
All data converted to SQL tables  
I used SQLiteStudio to view my tables and verify there was data in them. This was used as a troubleshooting measure when I having some issues visualizing the data and running queries on it.   
Had some issues with data being in the tables. That has been rectified and verified with a SQL query, along with the data showing in SQLiteStudio.   
Some database names were also updated so they would not be confused with the dataframe names.
