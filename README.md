# world_happiness
I currently have 4 datasets I am planning on using, although some of the columns/data may not be used by the end. 
world happiness report WHR- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated which encapsulates 2005-2024
world happiness index & inflation WHI- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agrafintech/world-happiness-index-and-inflation-dataset covering 2015-2023
suicide rate and life expectancy L&D- from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/suicide-rate-and-life-expectancy which I merged into 1 single dataset using "Country" as a key value
